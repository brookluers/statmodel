__statmodel__ is a set of type definitions and generic functions to
support [Go](http://golang.org) packages that fit statistical models.
It does not implement any specific statistical models, see
[goglm](http://github.com/kshedden/goglm) for an implementation of
Generalized Linear Models that uses this package.
